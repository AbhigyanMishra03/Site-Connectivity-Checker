# Site-Connectivity-Checker
A site connectivity checker is an application that helps us to monitor whether a website is available or not. There are many times when we open a url and the site isnâ€™t available. To avoid such troubles we can use a website connectivity checker. The user just needs to input the url and it will be checked and availability will be visible.
